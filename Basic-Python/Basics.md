```

## Constants

Fixed Values such as numbers , letters , and strings are called "constants" - because their value do not change

```python
>>>print(123)
123
>>>print("Hello")

```

## Variables

A Variable is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve data using the variable "name"

```python
