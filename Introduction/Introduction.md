## Compiler vs Interpreter

| **Feature**           | **Compiler**                                         | **Interpreter**                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**          | Translates code into machine code before execution.  | Translates code line by line during execution.   |
| **Speed**              | Faster execution (precompiled).                      | Slower execution (line-by-line).                 |
| **Output**             | Produces an executable file.                         | Does not produce an executable.                  |
| **Example Languages**  | C, C++, Java (via bytecode).                         | Python, JavaScript.                              |

## Python

Interpreted , High - Level , General-Purpose Programming Language

Python is mostly an interpreted language and not a compiled one although compilation is a step

### Advantages

- Platform - Independent
- Dynamic Typing - Flexible
- Automatic Memory allocation and garbage collection
- Supports classes , modules , exceptions
- Permits components and reuse
- Powerful Containers : Lists , Tuple , Dictionaries , etc.

### Disadvantages 

- Sometimes difficult to debug
